This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It's a good way to start exploring React without the overhead of configuring your environment which can be cumbersome especially when your first starting out

Run `yarn start` from the app's root directory and visit `localhost:3000` to see the code run.
